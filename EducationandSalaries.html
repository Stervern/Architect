<p>Prospective architects must complete a professional degree program that is accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board in order to become licensed in most states. High school graduates who want to become an architect may enroll in a Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch.) program. Students who have already earned a bachelor's degree in another field like architectural history or construction management and want to pursue a career as an architect may matriculate to a Master of Architecture (M.Arch.) program. These advanced programs are also open to applicants who have professional B.Arch. degrees and want to specialize in a field, such as historic preservation, design theory or solar design.
The B.Arch. program is typically completed in five years, while pre-professional bachelor's degree programs in architectural studies or construction management take four years to complete. 
Students can earn a professional M.Arch. degree in two years with a pre-professional undergraduate degree in architecture or three years with a bachelor's in another field. 
Students who have already completed a B.Arch. program can generally complete an M.Arch. program in one year.</p>

<a id="education-and-salaries" class="anchor" href="#education-and-salaries" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a> Type of Professional Degrees in Architecture</h3>
<p>Undergraduate degrees in architecture generally fall into two categories - professional degrees (usually five years in length) and pre-professional degrees (usually four years in length). The School of Architecture offers both types of undergraduate degrees. The Bachelor of Architecture is a first-professional degree that is evaluated and accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board and contains the required academic coursework to pursue internship, and eventually, licensure. The Bachelor of Science in Architectural Studies is a pre-professional degree that contains part of the coursework required for licensure, but must be followed by a professional degree in architecture in order for one to pursue licensure.</p>
<h4>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>=Bachelor of Science in Architecture</h4>
<p>A Bachelor of Science in Architecture is a 4-year, pre-professional degree. 
Although it include classes like physics, architectural design, construction materials and computer-aided drafting, it doesn't qualify graduates to become licensed architects. 
Graduates who want to work as architects must enroll in a Master of Architecture program.</p>
<h4>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>=Bachelor of Architecture</h4>
<p>A 5-year Bachelor of Architecture, or B.Arch., is a professional degree program. Students take classes in design, building materials, architectural history and architectural theory. 
Students also build models and complete design projects. They may study abroad in order to explore international design styles. 
Although graduates only need a B.Arch. to be eligible for licensure, they need to complete several years of supervised training before actually becoming licensed.</p>
<h4>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>=Master of Architecture</h4>
<p>Graduates of B.S. in Architecture programs who want to work as architects must complete a Master of Architecture (M.Arch.). 
This professional program takes two years to complete and includes significant applied practice and research.</p>
<h4>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>=Professional Training</h4>
<p>Graduates of professional architecture programs must train under a licensed architect and earn a total of 700 internship units before receiving their license. 
Each internship unit is equal to eight hours of training, and it typically takes three years of full-time work to complete the 700 units.</p>

<p>The median annual wage for architects was $73,090 in May 2012. 
The median wage is the wage at which half the workers in an occupation earned more than that amount and half earned less. 
The lowest 10 percent earned less than $44,600, and the top 10 percent earned more than $118,230.
Some firms pay tuition and fees toward continuing education requirements for their employees.
Most architects work full time and many work long hours, especially when facing deadlines. 
Self-employed architects may have more flexible work hours.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
