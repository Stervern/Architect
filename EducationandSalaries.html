<p>Prospective architects must complete a professional degree program that is accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board in order to become licensed in most states. High school graduates who want to become an architect may enroll in a Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch.) program. Students who have already earned a bachelor's degree in another field like architectural history or construction management and want to pursue a career as an architect may matriculate to a Master of Architecture (M.Arch.) program. These advanced programs are also open to applicants who have professional B.Arch. degrees and want to specialize in a field, such as historic preservation, design theory or solar design.

The B.Arch. program is typically completed in five years, while pre-professional bachelor's degree programs in architectural studies or construction management take four years to complete. 
Students can earn a professional M.Arch. degree in two years with a pre-professional undergraduate degree in architecture or three years with a bachelor's in another field. 
Students who have already completed a B.Arch. program can generally complete an M.Arch. program in one year.</p>

<p>A Bachelor of Science in Architecture is a 4-year, pre-professional degree. 
Although it include classes like physics, architectural design, construction materials and computer-aided drafting, it doesn't qualify graduates to become licensed architects. 
Graduates who want to work as architects must enroll in a Master of Architecture program.</p>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
