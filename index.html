<p> Architects design buildings and other structures. 
In addition to considering the way these buildings and structures look, they also make sure they are functional, safe, economical and suit the needs of the people who use them.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Architecture?</h3>

<p> Architecture has to do with planning, designing and constructing form, space and ambience to reflect functional, technical, social, environmental and aesthetic considerations. 
It requires the creative manipulation and coordination of materials and technology, and of light and shadow. 
Often, conflicting requirements must be resolved. The practise of Architecture also encompasses the pragmatic aspects of realizing buildings and structures, including scheduling, cost estimation and construction administration. 
Documentation produced by architects, typically drawings, plans and technical specifications, defines the structure and/or behavior of a building or other kind of system that is to be or has been constructed.</p>

  <p>Master architects typically don't get the respect and celebrity of other artists like painters. 
  Yet their work arguably has a greater effect on us in the long term. 
  Buildings shelter and protect us throughout our lives for home, work and play. And architecture is essentially the art we live in. 
  Even if we've never been in any of the buildings designed by master architects, we've probably been in plenty that incorporate their influences.</p>
