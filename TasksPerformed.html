<a id="education-and-salaries" class="anchor" href="#education-and-salaries" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Typical Work Activities</h3>
<p>Architects are involved from the earliest stages of a building project, which can start with developing ideas with the client, establishing budgets, assessing the needs of the building and its users, and its impact within the local environment.
<br>
They assist with site selection and work closely with contractors on site, ensuring that works are carried out to specific standards and that, above all, the building is sustainable, functional and aesthetically pleasing. They also need to have an awareness of commercial and financial considerations.</p>
<h4>

<a id="education-and-salaries" class="anchor" href="#education-and-salaries" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Career Development</h3>
<p>Gaining chartered membership of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA)  and undertaking agreed levels of continuing professional development (CPD) are key parts of career development and will enable progression to more senior posts.
<br>
Architects with more than five years of Chartered membership who have demonstrated distinguished achievement in architecture may be awarded Fellow of RIBA status and entitled to use the affix FRIBA.
<br>
In private practices, there is no set career structure, with promotion and career development dependent on the individual firm and on the architect's professional competence, reputation and field of employment.
<br>
Generally, there are more opportunities to advance through the company structure with larger firms.
<br>
With experience, a considerable number of architects set up their own practices.
<br>
In the public sector, career progression differs in structure and is influenced by the nature and responsibilities of public institutions. In local authorities and the Civil Service, it is possible to progress to the position of chief architect or to become head of a much larger department employing other built environment professionals.
<br>
It is also common for professionals to move between local authorities and between organisations in the private sector in order to gain broader experience and seek more senior positions.
